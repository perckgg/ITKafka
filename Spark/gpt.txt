To analyze this kind of dataset in Spark, you can load it as a DataFrame and define relevant features based on the structure of the data. Since your data contains nested JSON structures, Spark’s support for JSON and DataFrame APIs make it a great fit. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. Loading Data in Spark
Since your data is in JSON format, you can use spark.read.json to load it directly:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SystemAnalysis").getOrCreate()

# Load JSON data
data_path = "path/to/your/data.json"
df = spark.read.json(data_path)
2. Flattening the Data
Spark can work with nested JSON, but you may want to flatten certain fields to make it easier to analyze. Use select or withColumn to create new columns with flattened or transformed data:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, explode

# Example of flattening nested structures
flattened_df = df.select(
    col("basic_info.computer_name").alias("ComputerName"),
    col("basic_info.OS").alias("OS"),
    col("cpu.name").alias("CPUName"),
    col("cpu.cores").alias("CPUCores"),
    col("cpu.ultilization").alias("CPUUtilization"),
    explode("gpu").alias("gpu_info"),
    col("network.ip").alias("IP"),
    col("network.mac").alias("MAC"),
    col("ram.total").alias("TotalRAM"),
    col("ram.used").alias("UsedRAM"),
    col("ram.percentage").alias("RAMPercentage"),
    explode("ram.details").alias("RAMDetails"),
    col("battery.percent").alias("BatteryPercent"),
    explode("physical_disks.disk_list").alias("DiskList"),
    col("physical_disks.total_memory_used").alias("TotalDiskMemoryUsed")
)
3. Key Features to Analyze
Depending on your goals, here are some useful features for system performance and resource utilization analysis:

CPU Utilization:

Average, min, and max CPU utilization.
CPU core count vs. utilization (to identify potential under/over-utilization).
Processes running and logical processors.
GPU Specifications:

GPU memory usage, compute units, and clock speed.
Analyze GPU utilization by vendor and name to detect patterns across vendors and GPU types.
RAM Utilization:

Total and used RAM, along with percentage used.
RAM type, speed, and form factor distribution.
Capacity per RAM bank.
Disk Usage:

Total disk size and percentage used.
Partition sizes and media types.
Disk model, interface type, and health status.
Battery and Power:

Battery charge level and power status (plugged/unplugged).
Discharge rates over time (if data has a time component).
Network Information:

IP, MAC addresses, connection type, and internet card speed.
Analyze network speeds to identify potential bottlenecks.
4. Sample Aggregations and Transformations
Here’s how you might create some aggregations to analyze specific features:

python
Copy code
# Average CPU Utilization
avg_cpu_util = flattened_df.groupBy("ComputerName").agg({"CPUUtilization": "avg"})

# RAM Usage Summary
ram_usage = flattened_df.groupBy("ComputerName").agg({"TotalRAM": "max", "UsedRAM": "max", "RAMPercentage": "max"})

# Disk Usage and Partition Analysis
disk_usage = flattened_df.select("ComputerName", "DiskList.size", "TotalDiskMemoryUsed").groupBy("ComputerName").sum("size")
5. Visualization and Interpretation
After the data transformations and aggregations, consider exporting the results or using Spark’s integration with visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for further analysis.
